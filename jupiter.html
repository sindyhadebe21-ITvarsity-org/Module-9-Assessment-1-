				<h1>Jupiter</h1>
                <p class="intro">
                    Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. Jupiter is a gas giant. It is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter has a very thick atmosphere. Jupiter has rings, but they’re very hard to see. One day on Jupiter goes by in just 10 hours. One year on Jupiter is the same as 11.8 Earth years. Jupiter has 79 confirmed moons.

                     The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere, deflecting destructive solar winds.
